# AdvancedOO

Advanced object-oriented programming techniques such as graphical user interfaces, animation, sound, music, networking, parallelism, 
client-server and XML using game design as an example. Topics in object-oriented program design including UML and design patterns. 
Introduction to advanced Java APIs such as awt, swing, io, nio, sound, net and xml. This course was a week long, we were there for 
8 hours a day. Lecture would be the first 3 and half hours with the assignment taking the final 3 and half hours and 
the exam was written on the Saturday.

# Assignment 1

This was getting the initial game working, we were given a skeleton where we had to fill in the code that was 
missing to get the program to work. The initial set up involved dealing with the cards and priority of the cards
including the halfturme and the execute for it, and the regular turn and the execute for it. The next part was working 
on the location and the effect for it. With the location we then worked on the pusher part of the game board, and that
was just implementing the effect. With this information we could then work on the step portion and make sure that with each
move the robot could make the proper step. From there we went into RoboRace to get the program started and implemented
the run to get the game working and test it with some basic function, and to see the XML work.

# Assignment 2

Today we were given the program with the Player, GameMaster and Main to fill out and implement. This was to focus on
implementing threads and working with more of the XML. In player we had to deal with the run and get it so that the 
robot was on its own JFRAME so later we can have 2 players on the screen. Player also had to be dealt its own thread 
for the same reasons. GameMaster was just filling it out and makeing it threaded, with its run going through the moves
that can be made or events. In the main we had to initialize each thread for each player in the game and be able to have
the game work.

# Assignment 3

This day was about implementing the interface and using the CardPane, Factory, and BoardCanvas. With the CardPane it was
working on the mouseClicked and using the events to handle the mouse. With the paint component it was drawing the board
and then modifying the board for each update of the board. WIth factory it was working with the XML to determine what happens
in the map and to help update the graphics. In BoardCancas it was assigning it to a thread and then updating the board
as well as starting the game and completing the game.

# Assignment 4

The last day of work was getting the server running and playing with the sounds. This was more of a free day of work
and it was just more or less seeing if you could get it running and you could have other users join your game. It was also
about getting the sounds working in the GameEvents and using midifiles successfully.
